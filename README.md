# BrainGame

### About
This is our test task for BEST hackatone (theme - mind development).
BrainGame is a mind development game which consists of 3 mini-games that are supposed to crack your mind a little :)
The app has an authentication module which allows users to keep thrack of their best scores and also compete with each other.

The design is particularly unique and does not contain any refences to an overrated sensational Korean sea food related game series!

### Installation

1. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
2. Build the app and run metro bundler with `yarn start`
